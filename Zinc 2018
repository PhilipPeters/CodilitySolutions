""" Solution to the Zinc 2018 problem, link here: https://app.codility.com/programmers/challenges/zinc2018/
Short Version: Given an array A, count the number of different triplets (a, b, c) in which a occurs before b and b occurs before c.

As usual, we use a dynamic programming approach, but we need not to just track the number of triplets up to a certain point, but
also the number of pairs up until a certain point, and the number of singletons (i.e. individual elements). We also need a way of 
keeping track of how many 'new' pairs or singletons appear, so we use a separate structure (a dictionary) to record how many tuples are 
seen, ending at a certain value.

Notes in the code: dictionary.get(key, value) returns dictionary[key] if this is a valid operation, else it just returns value.
                   this is just a work-around for not using a defaultdict, and performs in exactly the same way.

The array tuples[[]] records the number of distinct tuples seen up to a certain point, of a certain length, i.e. tuples[i][n] records
the number of distinct tuples of length i up until the point n.

Code is below: """

        M.add(A[n-1])
        tuples[1][n] = len(M)
    for k in range(2, 4):
        tuples[k][k] = 1
        """This dictionary records the number of length k tuples ending with element A[k-1]. Note that if we have a sub-array ending in x, 
        then the number of k-tuples ending in x is the total number of k-1 tuples in the sub-array of this sub-array without the last element"""
